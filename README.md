# Logic 2020 v0.0.1 Alpha #

Available at [logic2020.info](logic2020.info)

Logic 2020 is a Django/React project meant to be an educational tool for students studying Logic.
It is based off of Logic 2010, an educational application that is adopted by many Universities in the United States and Canada.
Logic 2020 is meant to be an updated, web-based version of that.

## Current Features ##

This application is currently is Alpha, so does not have that many features yet.
Currently the user is presented with one simple Sentential Logical Derivationa and is asked to solve it. No tutorial is
given, just a series of buttons that the user can play around with, and solve the problem if they are already knowledgeable
about derivation syntax.
Currently the user can Show conclusions, Assume premises, and use Rules such as Modus Ponens and Modus Tolens.

## Future Features ##

For the Beta build, more problems and Rules will be added for the user to utilize. User authentication will also be added so 
as to allow users to track which problems they have solved.

1.0 will likely have tutorials incorporated into it, with a full set of sentential logic problems for the user to solve.
Moving past 1.0 will be the addition of more types of logical problems like Predicate Logic and Symbolization.
